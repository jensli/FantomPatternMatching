Set env var:
java_home=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.6.0-openjdk

Bug in fanlauch when CLASSPATH is empty?

Set in fan/etc/build:

devHome=file:/home/jens/bin/fan/
jdkHome=file:/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/
devHome

Build with this command:
{relHome}/bin/fan {relHome}/adm/bootstrap.fan

Check for env vars that should not be set.

Set to rel dir to build compiler in dev:
FAN_SUBSTITUTE=/home/jens/bin/fan_dir
export FAN_SUBSTITUTE

Summary

In summary, you want to make sure of a couple key things:

    setup your rel installation and never touch it (consider it readonly)
    ensure jdkHome and dotnetHome are configured in both rel and dev etc/build/config.props
    ensure rel etc/build/config.props devHome points to your dev installation
    make sure your substitutes are configured correctly:
        on Unix make sure your FAN_SUBSTITUTE env points to the rel installation
        on Windows make sure your dev etc/sys/config.props substitutes are configured
    only put dev bin your path and always run your scripts from the dev installation
    never use a working repo for bootstrap (use only the boot repo)
